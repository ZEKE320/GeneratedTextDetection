            "Abstract This paper proposes a technique for adding a new source or target language to an existing multilingual NMT model without retraining it on the initial set of languages. It consists in replacing the shared vocabulary with a small language-specific vocabulary and fine-tuning the new embeddings on the new language’s parallel data. Some additional language-specific components may be trained to improve performance (e.g., Transformer layers or adapter modules). Because the parameters of the original model are not modified, its performance on the initial languages does not degrade. We show on two sets of experiments (small-scale on TED Talks, and largescale on ParaCrawl) that this approach performs as well or better as the more costly alternatives; and that it has excellent zero-shot performance: training on English-centric data is enough to translate between the new language and any of the initial languages. Introduction Multilingual Neural Machine Translation models are trained on multilingual data to translate from and/or into multiple languages (Firat et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2017). Multilingual NMT is a compelling approach in production, as one only needs to train, deploy and maintain one model (instead of 2 × N ones, where N is the number of languages). It has also been shown to improve MT quality for low-resource languages (at the cost of a slight degradation for high-resource languages) and it can allow translation between languages that have no aligned data (“zero-shot translation”). However, such models can be costly to train, as they usually involve larger architectures and large datasets. Moreover, because they are trained jointly on all the languages, they require to know in advance the full set of languages. Adding a new language to an existing model usually means retraining the model on the full multilingual dataset. Naively fine-tuning the original model on the new language’s data is not an option because of vocabulary mismatch (the shared vocabulary needs to be modified to include the new language’s tokens) and catastrophic forgetting (the model will quickly forget how to translate in the other languages). In this paper, we study the problem of multilingual NMT incremental training or continual learning and propose a novel way to efficiently add a new source or target language. Some desirable properties of an incremental training method are: • No degradation on the existing language pairs; • Efficient training (e.g., no re-training on the existing language pairs); • Minimal amount of added parameters: the approach should scale to many languages and the model fit on a single GPU; • Minimal degradation in inference speed; • Good zero-shot performance: when training with X-EN (or EN-X) data, where X is a new language, we would like the model to be able to translate from X to any known language Y (resp. from Y to X). We propose a novel technique for incrementally adding a new source or target language, which consists in substituting the shared embedding matrix with a language-specific embedding matrix, which is fine-tuned on the new language’s data only while freezing the other parameters of the model. In some cases (e.g., when the new language is on the target size), a small number of additional parameters (e.g., adapter modules) have to be trained to match the performance of the re-training baseline. We perform two sets of experiments, with a 20-language Transformer Base trained on TED Talks, and a 20- language Transformer Big (with deep encoder and shallow decoder) trained on ParaCrawl; and show that this approach is fast and parameter-efficient and that it performs as well or better as the more costly alternatives. We propose a new technique for incrementally training multilingual NMT models on a new source or target language. It consists in creating a new monolingual BPE vocabulary for that language, substituting the shared embedding matrix with language-specific embeddings, and training those while freezing the other model parameters. At inference, translating in any of the initial languages is done by using the initial shared embeddings, and translating in the new language is done by using the newly trained embeddings. This approach does not change performance on the initial languages as the initial parameters are kept aside and not modified. For new source languages, it can achieve close performance to the more costly and less flexible bilingual and re-training baselines. For new target languages, this technique can be combined with language-specific parameters (finetuned Transformer layers or adapter modules) to match baseline performance at a small parameter cost. We validate this technique on two sets of experiments: small-scale on TED Talks and largescale on ParaCrawl; and show that it is compatible with two architectures: Transformer Base 6-6 and Big 12-2. We also show that incremental training on data aligned with English is enough to learn to translate between the new language and any of the initial languages\n"

The problem of translation to a group of typologically similar languages is also discussed here. 3. Translation and localization 2.1 A pivot language Localization of products and their documentation is a great problem for any company, which wants to strengthen its position on foreign language market, especially for companies producing various kinds of software. The amounts of texts being localized are huge and the localization costs are huge as well. It is quite clear that the localization from one source language to several target languages, which are typologically similar, but different from the source language, is a waste of money and effort. It is of course much easier to translate texts from Czech to Polish or from Russian to Bulgarian than from English or German to any of these languages. There are several reasons, why localization and translation is not being performed through some pivot language, representing a certain group of closely related languages. Apart from political reasons the translation through a pivot language has several drawbacks. The most important one is the problem of the loss of translation quality. Each translation may to a certain extent shift the meaning of the translated text and thus each subsequent translation provides results more and more different from the original. The second most important reason is the lack of translators from the pivot to the target language, while this is usually no problem for the translation from the source directly to the target language. 2.2 Translation memory is the key The main goal of this paper is to suggest how to overcome these obstacles by means of a combination of an MT system with commercial MAHT (Machine-aided human translation) systems. We have chosen the TRADOS Translator's Workbench as a representative system of a class of these products, which can be characterized as an example-based translation tools. IBM's Translation Manager and other products also belong to this class. Such systems uses so-called translation memory, which contains pairs of previously translated sentences from a source to a target language. When a human translator starts translating a new sentence, the system tries to match the source with sentences already stored in the translation memory. If it is successful, it suggests the translation and the human translator decides whether to use it, to modify it or to reject it. The segmentation of a translation memory is a key feature for our system. The translation memory may be exported into a text file and thus allows easy manipulation with its content. Let us suppose that we have at our disposal two translation memories one human made for the source/pivot language pair and the other created by an MT system for the pivot/target language pair. The substitution of segments of a pivot language by the segments of a target language is then only a routine procedure. The human translator translating from the source language to the target language then gets a translation memory for the required pair (source/target). The system of penalties applied in TRADOS Translator's Workbench (or a similar system) guarantees that if there is already a human-made translation present, then it gets higher priority than the translation obtained as a result of the automatic MT. This system solves both problems mentioned above the human translators from the pivot to the target language are not needed at all and the machine- made translation memory serves only as a resource supporting the direct human translation from the source to the target language. 3.

Many works leverage distant supervision which automatically generates labeled data by pairing a knowledge graph with raw textual data. Distant supervision produces noisy labels and requires additional techniques, such as multi-instance learning (MIL), to denoise the training signal. However, MIL requires multiple instances of data and struggles with very long-tail datasets such as those found in the biomedical domain. In this work, we propose a novel reformulation of MIL for biomedical relation extraction that abstractifies biomedical entities into their corresponding semantic types. By grouping entities by types, we are better able to take advantage of the benefits of MIL and further denoise the training signal. We show this reformulation, which we refer to as abstractified multi-instance learning (AMIL), improves performance in biomedical relationship extraction. We also propose a novel relationship embedding architecture that further improves model performance. Introduction Relation extraction (RE) is a key facet of information extraction in large bodies of unstructured textual data. RE is particularly important in the biomedical domain where extracting relationships between pairs of biomedical entities, also known as \\fact triples\", can produce new insights into complicated biological interactions. For instance, with the near-exponential growth of microbiome research [Sa'ed et al., 2019], advanced RE methods may help discover important links between gut microbiota and diseases. It is in this context that we motivate our work. RE within the biomedical domain comes with two inherent challenges: there are more than 30 million scientific articles, with hundreds of thousands of articles published every year, and there is a corresponding lack of labeled data. To resolve these challenges, many have leveraged distant supervision techniques which pair knowledge graphs with raw textual data to automatically generate labels to train deep-learning models [Gu et al., 2019, Su et al., 2019, Junge and Jensen, 2019]. We seek to improve distantly supervised biomedical RE methods in this work. We use the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus [Bodenreider, 2004] for our knowledge graph and pair it with raw textual data from PubMed [Canese and Weis, 2013]. To automatically generate labels, distantly supervised RE methods rely on a simple yet powerful assumption: any singular sentence that contains a pair of entities also expresses a relationship, as determined by the accompanying knowledge graph, between those entities [Mintz et al., 2009]. However, this assumption leads to a noisy training signal with many false positives as not all sentences express a relationship between an entity pair. To combat this, many works have leveraged multi instance learning (MIL) [Riedel et al., 2010, Homann et al., 2011, Zeng et al., 2015] where, instead of assessing single sentences, MIL assesses positive and negative bags of sentences that contain the same entity pair. Grouping sentences into bags greatly reduces noise in the training signal since a bag of sentences is more likely to express a relationship than a single sentence. This enables the model to better classify relationships between unseen entity pairs. However, similar to many NLP tasks, biomedical RE users from a long-tail distribution of fact triples, where many entity pairs are only supported by a few sentences of evidence. After processing the PubMed corpus, we observe that a majority (52%) of extracted triples are supported by fewer than three sentences. Creating bags of sentences for such entity pairs requires heavy up-sampling. For example, if a pair of entities is only supported by one sentence and a bag size is equal to 16 sentences, the single sentence is duplicated 15 times to ll the bag. This erases the benet of MIL. To counter this issue, we introduce abstractified multi-instance learning (AMIL) where, instead of grouping entity pairs by name, we group entities by the corresponding semantic type as determined by UMLS. UMLS categorizes each entity with a semantic type within the UMLS semantic network. The UMLS semantic network is curated by human experts for decades and provides a rich ontology of biomedical concepts which we leverage to group multiple di erent entity pairs within a single MIL bag, reducing the need to up-sample sentences. For example, consider two sentences: (1) a sentence containing the entity pair (bula, tibia) and (2) a second sentence containing the entity pair (humerus, ulna). With distant supervision, we assume each sentence expresses the relationship linking both pairs, namely articulates with. Despite expressing the samewithout abstraction, these sentences are placed into separate MIL bags since bags are grouped by distinct entity pairs. By introducing abstractied multi-instance learning, the entities bula, tibia, humerus, and ulna are grouped by their corresponding UMLS semantic type|\\Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component.\" This allows us to place the aforementioned sentences into the same MIL bag based on their entity type, creating a heterogeneous bag of entity pairs that express the same relationship. With this reformulation, bags containing a single duplicated sentence are reduced by half. AMIL produces better overall performance for biomedical RE with significant performance gains for \\rare\" triples. Here, we dene \\rare\" triples as triples that are supported by fewer than eight sentences. These triples make up roughly 80% of the long-tail distribution of triples. We also take inspiration from Soares et al.(2019) and conduct a suite of experiments with variations of relationship embedding architectures. Such experiments are underexplored in the biomedical domain and many are novel to the general task of relationship classification. Soares et al. report the best RE performance using a relationship representation consisting of embedded entity start markers|special span tokens that denote the beginning of an entity. We test this RE architecture in the biomedical domain and also test the performance of entity end markers. Moreover, we introduce a novel relationship representation, namely the middle mention pool, which pools word pieces between head and tail entities. This embedding architecture is inspired by the observation that context between two biomedical entities in a sentence often contains the information-rich and relationship-relevant signal. Our best performing relationship embedding architecture results from the combination of both entity end markers and the middle mention pool. We observe that this architecture further increases the performance of our relation classification model. In this paper, we make the following contributions:Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We introduce abstractified multiple-instance learning (AMIL), which achieves new state-of-the art performance for biomedical relationship extraction. We also report significant performance gains for rare fact triples. Ã¢ÂÂ¢We propose an improved relationship representation for biomedical relation extraction. We show that concatenating embedding tokens from entity end markers with the middle mention pool produces the best performing model. Ã¢ÂÂ¢We make all our code, saved models, and preprocessing scripts publicly available1 to facilitate future biomedical RE eorts. Pre-processing scripts can impact model performance and are important to prepare an up-to-date, ready-for-RE dataset from ever-growing PubMed and UMLS. Our results in Section 5 show that using updated pre-processing tools can improve model performance by 10%. Related Work. Early works combining distant supervision with relation extraction [Bunescu and Mooney, 2007, Craven and Kumlien, 1999] relied on the strong assumption claiming that, if a relationship between two entities exists, then all sentences containing those entities express the corresponding relationship. This assumption was relaxed by Riedel et al. (2010) with the introduction of multi-instance learning (MIL) which claimed that if a relationship exists between two entities, at least one sentence that contains the two entities may express the corresponding relation. Homann et al. (2011) build on the work of Riedel et al. by allowing for overlapping relations. Zeng et al. (2015) extend distantly supervised RE by combining MIL with a novel piecewise convolutional neural network (PCNN). Lin et al. (2016) made further improvements by introducing an attention mechanism that attends to relevant information in a bag of sentences. This sentence-level attention mechanism for MIL inspired numerous subsequent works [Luo et al., 2017, Han et al., 2018a, Alt et al., 2019]. Han et al. (2018a) propose a joint training RE model that combines a knowledge graph with an attention mechanism and MIL. Dai et al. (2019) extend the work by Han et al. into the biomedical domain and use a PCNN for sentence encoding. Amin et al.(2020) propose an RE model that uses BioBERT [Lee et al., 2019], a pre trained transformer based on bert [Devlin et al., 2019], for sentence encoding. They leverage MIL with entity-marking methods following R-BERT [Wu and He, 2019] and achieve the best performance when the directionality of extracted triples is matched to the directionality from the UMLS knowledge graph. Notably, the model proposed by Amin et al.(2020) does not benet from sentence-level attention. We choose the model proposed by Amin et al.(2020) for our baseline model as itthe current state-of-the-art (SOTA) in biomedical RE. We also conduct a suite of experiments with variations of relationship embedding architectures. These experiments are inspired by Soares et al. (2019) who conduct experiments with six different embedding architectures and report performance on general-domain RE datasets. They show that constructing a relationship embedding architecture for biomedical RE requires heavy up-sampling. For example, if a pair of entities is only supported by one sentence and a bag size is equal to 16 sentences, the single sentence is duplicated 15 times to ll the bag. This erases the benet of MIL. To counter this issue, we introduce abstractified multi-instance learning (AMIL) where, instead of grouping entity pairs by name, we group entities by the corresponding semantic type as determined by UMLS. UMLS categorizes each entity with a semantic type within the UMLS semantic network. The UMLS semantic network is curated by human experts for decades and provides a rich ontology of biomedical concepts which we leverage to group multiple di erent entity pairs within a single MIL bag, reducing the need to up-sample sentences. For example, consider two sentences:\n"
